## Continued work on clocks and seeking support

Here's a very raw preview of seeking support utilising speed changes. Rewind support isn't completely implemented, but can be generally fixed with a [few lines of change](//puu.sh/zPnAJ/c2e84d6ed2.mp4) (though the correct solution will take a bit more thinking, as this was achieved by disabling some game-wide optimisations).

The end goal is to allow seeking in both directions with completely accurate scoring and playback. I actually already achieved this on [lazer-transitional](https://blog.ppy.sh/post/146687255823/a-long-overdue-update) in a distant past and am using similar techniques to reimplement this on lazer, so it's quite familiar (yet still daunting) territory!

## Added support for lead-in time

Makes a lot of maps playable that previously weren't. Haven't extensively tested this yet, and it will likely receive further revisions over the next few days.

## Other things

- Fix disabling mouse buttons causing auto to stop working [#677](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/677).
- osu!taiko difficulty calculations are in! Note that this will only apply to newly imported beatmaps [#675](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/675).
- osu!taiko drumroll conversion has received some minor fixes [#663](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/663).
- ..as have swells (spinner converts) [#676](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/676).
- My changes from yesterday have been merged (improving replay playback accuracy) [#672](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/672) & [#667](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/667).

## New release available

2017.426.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.426.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)! Contains everything above.
