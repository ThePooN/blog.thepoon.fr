## Tooltips

After multiple iterations, we have a working tooltip solution via this [pull request](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/653). A combined effort between myself and jorolf, these new tooltips should reflect what we used to have in osu-stable but at the same time add a new feel via animations.

Note that these are not heavily deployed throughout the interface yet; this will happen over time.

## Minor changes

- Sliderbars sound effects have been tamed a bit.
- Fixed chat timestamps being in 12-hour time.
- [API updates](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/657) to allow statistics to be shown at the results screen.

## New release available

2017.420.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.420.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)!

This build sees the **initial release of the results screen** to the public. As mentioned multiple times, the design is not yet complete, but it's a huge leap forward from what we've had until now! You can click through to the results screen from leaderboards at song select, or play a map and experience it for yourself.
