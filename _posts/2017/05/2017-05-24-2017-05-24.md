First of all, thanks to everyone who reads these posts! I took a moment to [ask on twitter](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/867041831371939841) as to how often people would like me to digest development changes, as I mentioned it takes quite a bit of time and effort to prepare daily posts.

The [results](https://twitter.com/ppy/status/867045099166879748) are quite spread over the first three options, but "per release" sits best with me (and is also the most popular) so I'm going to go with that. I'll still keep the post titles as the current date because I don't want to tie my posts 100% to releases for now.

## osu!taiko visual improvements

[smoogipooo](https://github.com/smoogipooo) has taken a step back from osu!mania to update the visuals of taiko. You can now enjoy more epic kiai time, better feeling hit explosions and overall a smoother visual experience.

## osu! logo beat sync

Finally, the osu! logo [bounces in time](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/833) with the music - even at the beatmap loading screen! osu!lazer has honestly felt hollow without this implemented until now. Note that we also have [screen-edge flashes](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/812) (thanks to [ColdVolcano](https://github.com/ColdVolcano) with huge code review from smoogi and I) at the main menu too.

Now that we have the [framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/828) [in](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/831) [place](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/841) for synchronising arbitrary UI elements to the beatmap, you can be sure to see more of this playfulness happening all over the UI. With moderation, of course.

## User panels

We now have a full user panel implementation thanks to [DrabWeb](https://github.com/DrabWeb) (see [#825](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/825)). While you can't see it changing state in the game currently, you *can* see your own user panel by clicking the user login area top-right.

## Spinner colours improved

As per my previous blog post, we needed some framework changes to allow for more vivid spinner colours. The changes [were made](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/737) by [paparony03](https://github.com/paparony03) and as a result I was [able to](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/817) bring the spinners closer in-line with their design!
