Quite some good progress today! Let's dive into it.

## Updated spinner design

The lazer spinner design was nothing short of temporary. It was laggy to boot. Today I spent a [great deal of time](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/791) realising flyte's newer design in full detail. Take a look at it isolated:

and in a map:

Note that due to some deficiencies in our framework regarding how glows are rendered, the colours are *not correct* and *not final*. It will look much more vibrant once these issues are addressed:
