## Updated skip button design

The skip button was sitting in a weird place on the screen, so we decided to throw it away and [start fresh](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/801). The new one features a countdown bar and a much larger hit area. It also gets out of your way when you're busy watching amazing storyboards.

Note that the sound effect is missing in this video for whatever reason. Go download lazer if you wanna try it yourself :).
