Been quite a bit going on, even though I missed a post on Friday. Let's catch up!

## Mod overlay

Building on some [work](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/702) by [Evast](https://github.com/EVAST9919), we now have an in-game overlay showing currently enabled mods. Here's an example of how it looks:

<video src="//puu.sh/zPnuU/30a1df685a.mp4" controls preload="metadata" />

With this came some further refactoring to the way mod icons are displayed to make it easier to reuse them in the future.

## Other things

- The osu! window now defaults to a higher frame rate when inactive (30 -> 60). This should provide a smoother feeling experience even when the window isn't focused [#694](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/694).
- Fix mod selection accepting escape when it shouldn't (after entering play mode with it still open) [#723](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/723).
- The cursor trail should now look smoother than ever before, thanks to [WebFreak001](https://github.com/WebFreak001)'s work [#717](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/717).

## New release available

2017.508.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.508.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)! Contains everything from the last couple of days.

p.s. there should be a pretty big announcement tomorrow, so keep an eye on the osu! news feeds.
