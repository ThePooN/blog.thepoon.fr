A few days without a post. Alas, I've been busy with the [AX announcement](https://osu.ppy.sh/news/160469158898), accounting and general catching-up. There's also quite a bit of lazer progress to cover!

## Chat tabs

I completed basic support for subscribing to multiple chat channels today. While you can't choose which channels you join (they are hard-coded) and can only post in #lazer due to API limitations, this is a step forward towards having fully flexible chat.

## Other things

- Fixed occasional unexpected logouts (oauth refresh token wasn't correctly being read from config) [#736](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/736).
- Fixed chat textbox not always keeping focus [#735](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/735).
- The osu!mania implementation is going smoothly. More on that from smoogi tomorrow, maybe!
- Fix for global hotkeys (like alt-enter) not working when a textbox has focus [#706](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/706).

## No release today

Would've, could've, but there's a regression I'd like to fix before pushing anything out.
