It feels like it's been an eternity since we last talked! I'll do my best to bring you up to speed with everything that's been going on.

## Triangles are now more efficient

smoogipooo and Tom94 pair programmed a [new implementation](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/857) of triangle patterns. Since these are displayed everywhere in lazer, it is one of the areas that definitely required some optimisation.

Performance improvements upwards of 20% can be observed when many triangles were displayed on the screen at once.

## Scroll drifting fixes

When scrolling beyond the bounds of a scrollable view, it was possible for the cursor to become misaligned. This has been fixed in both the [generic](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/763) `ScrollContainer` and the `ChatOverlay`, which has a slightly custom [drag mechanic](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/870) which was also drifting.

## New animation when changing between mods

Thanks to [jorolf](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/864) for the concept.

## osu!mania is getting more complete

smoogipooo has been [busy](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/850) [making](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/877) [continuous](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/876) [progress](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/873) on mania. Here's a little preview of how things are going!

Auto isn't quite there yet, but it is already quite playable in the release builds :). Holds are now in, along with very basic judgement.

## Framework maintenance

There was also some [substantial](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/869) [work](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/762) done by myself and Tom94 to clean up input handling at a `Drawable` level in the framework. `Drawable`s are no longer aware of their parent `InputManager`, as they don't need to be. One more step in the right direction for the framework!

## Other things

- DrabWeb made a [breadcrumb control](//puu.sh/zPnWk/87f1876731.mp4), which will make an appearance in future in-game UI [#865](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/865).
- Linux mouse input is no longer handled when the window is not in focus [#761](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/761).
- The back button now bounces in time with the active beatmap [#848](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/848).
- The hotkey for drawings was changed to Shift-Alt-D as to not conflict with osu!direct [#867](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/867).
- Fixed a few potential hard-crashes when failing to load a beatmap [#862](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/862).
- When first loading the music controller, it no longer slides in, instead already being in the correct initial state [#856](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/856).

## New release available

2017.529.0 is now available from [github releases](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases/tag/v2017.529.0) (or via auto-update if you already have lazer installed)!
