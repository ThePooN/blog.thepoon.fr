title: June 2018 Development Update
date: 2018-05-04
---

Hello everyone!

We've been making steady progress in all areas over the last month. Yes, I guess these posts have become a monthly thing, but I am going to take this opportunity to embrace the monthly schedule and align it to development schedule.

Since earlier this year, we have been assigning tasks to a monthly "milestone" and then trying out best to complete them all by the time the month ends. After a bit of trial and error, we are gradually accustoming ourselves to this process and meeting higher rates of completion month on month.

We also have the new [changelog system](https://osu.ppy.sh/home/changelog) that is approaching completion, which will replace much of the content (ie. per-change explanations) I usually cover in my blog once complete, so I will be shifting my focus here to focusing on a more macro scale of "how we did last month" and "what we have planned for this month".

I'd just like to mention that much of the process we're following is heavily borrowing from the [vscode project](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode), so huge props to them for their amazing open development efforts and solid [development process](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/wiki/Development-Process). They obviously have a much larger team and dedicated project management so we are taking some shortcuts, but I'm pushing for more process as it feels feasible and productive.

# June 2018 Goals

In an interest of establishing a schedule we can adhere to, I'm going to keep the goals slim this month. Not mentioned in this list is the huge backlog of issues that require fixing, which can be found assigned to the [respective](https://github.com/ppy/osu/milestone/36) [monthly](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/milestone/13) [milestones](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/milestone/13).

### Move both osu and osu-framework to target netcore2.1

I hope we can fix remaining netcore issues (mouse hiding and other native functionality) in order to make .NET core our primary target framework by the end of this month. The 2.1 release fixes the remaining issues we had with debugging the solution on macOS and brings performance on a level that surpasses both mono and .NET desktop (471).

### Add automatic error reporting on hard crash

Many people are reporting hard crash issues on github without knowledge of how to report correctly or fix. I hope to make this reporting automated (via Sentry) and remove this manual overhead.

### Add automatic nuget package builds of osu and osu-framework

As the number of projects dependent on these increases, referencing them via submodule is getting quite cumbersome. By deploying nuget packages we can more easily keep individual projects segregated and maintainable.

### Begin work on multiplayer lobby system

With more of the UI designs nearing completion, it feels about time that we get the infrastructure in place for osu!lazer multiplayer. This is a stretch goal and will likely not reach the point of gameplay being possible, but the lobby and room system should at least have some client-server structure in place.

### Basic structural implementation of osu!mania editor

As we move the editor forward, we want to allow for arbitrary rulesets to be easily added with first-class editing facilities. In order to make sure everything is structured correctly, we will be focusing on getting the osu!mania setup in a usable yet modular way.

### Complete the new changelog page

As mentioned in my previous post, this will be the new hub for keeping track of the ongoing development efforts invested in osu!. Having the new design completely deployed will reduce the strain on me to manually produce changelogs in a blog format and hopefully make tracking development more accessible for the wider audience.

### Move `osu-web` score lookups to elasticsearch

I have been performing ongoing migration of MySQL servers to new hardware and software (5.6/5.7 to 8.0). In order to complete the last stages, I would first like to reduce load (and reliance) on the servers. Moving score lookups to elasticsearch will do this, but also allow for arbitrary lookups which have not been possible until now due to lack of indices.

### New private messaging system

We've been working on the framework required to get a private messaging system deployed to replace the ageing (and disconnected) forum-based system that is only accessible on the old site. While a bit of a stretch goal, we hope to have this deployed by the end of the month.

# New Projects

As we push forward with open sourcing each component of the osu! ecosystem, a few new git repositories have popped up which you may wish to follow:

### [osu-tools](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools)

This will contain any command line tools (.NET core) which consume lazer. Currently you will find a difficulty calculator tool which will be the go-to method of testing new Star Rating changes.

### [osu-server](https://github.com/ppy/osu-tools)

This will contain server-side components that don't fit in the current laravel system. This repository is still undergoing some structural consideration as we decide how many git repos we want, but for now will house the [.NET core version](https://github.com/ppy/osu-server/pull/2) of [osu-performance](https://github.com/ppy/osu-performance) (Performance Point calculations) and a new [Elasticsearch score indexer](https://github.com/ppy/osu-server/pull/1) â€“ part of an ongoing effort to alleviate MySQL of the heavy load of score/leaderboard lookups.

# May 2018 Review

## Milestone completion

### osu-web

![](https://puu.sh/AyG1X/11a9fd9c49.png)

Pretty good progress and relatively high completion rates, no? Let's delve into detail in each respective project. This might be the last time I do this if the new changelog page goes as planned (I won't miss it!).

## [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu) *The osu!lazer project. The future of the osu! client. Download preview releases from [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases) and follow along!*

### Fix catch sizing [\#2632](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2632) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

After many months of Yuzu being completely oversized (big-boned; not fat), osu!catch gameplay scale has been refactored to mostly match stable.

![](https://puu.sh/AyIvl/a2b20901f0.png)

### Fix beatmap importing entering a bad state [\#2665](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2665) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

- Also: fix conflicting Hash and Online IDs on beatmap import [\#2673](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2673) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

A lot of users were reporting that beatmap imports were getting stuck. It turns out that a single failed import would hold up the import process indefinitely and cause all subsequent imports to fail. There were quite a few reasons for this happening, but most should now be resolved.

Do note that we are still tracking [one remaining case](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/2718) where imports can fail.

### Add hold-to-quit button for gameplay/replays [\#2430](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2430) ([UselessToucan](https://github.com/UselessToucan))

No-keyboard players rejoice! You can now pause or exit gameplay without a keyboard handy. This is a definite requirement for mobile support.

![](https://puu.sh/AyIU0/56fb4e3d3c.gif)

### Implement joystick input [\#2346](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2346) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

You can now bind joystick buttons, hats and axes to anything that was bindable in-game! This allows for a huge amount of new control customisation which was never before available - even on stable!

### Multiplayer lounge [\#2603](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2603) ([DrabWeb](https://github.com/DrabWeb))

While not yet functional, the designs for multiplayer are now more complete than ever. Don't you just want to see this list populated with real games?

## [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) *The new web front-end. [Already live](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) but hasn't yet replaced the old site, pending feature parity.*

### Add webhook for GitHub pull request merges [\#3286](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/3286) ([nanaya](https://github.com/nanaya))

### Spinner updates [\#3264](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/3264) ([nanaya](https://github.com/nanaya))

### Add loved beatmaps to user profile [\#3226](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/3226) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

### Delete scores on qualification [\#3207](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/3207) ([nanaya](https://github.com/nanaya))

### New Crowdin translations [\#3192](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/3192) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

Go [check it out](http://crowdin.com/project/osu-web) and chuck in some help if you can, but either reviewing and voting for existing translations or filling in the gaps!
