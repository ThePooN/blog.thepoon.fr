title: dev changelog 20180120
date: 2018-01-21
---

I promised more regular updated, but then the change of the year happened (and the rush to getting a new release of lazer out), but more importantly I ran into some issues with the tooling I made to create these posts.

After a long ordeal today, the tools are back in order and should be good going forward, so I'll try and keep this coming at least once a week!

Excuse the length this time around; we've been busy.

## [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu) *The osu!lazer project. The future of the osu! client. Download preview releases from [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases) and follow along!*

#### A lot of fixes to replay playback [\#1923](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1923) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

Replays can be dragged into the osu!lazer window again! Also fixes for replays playing unexpectedly at a large offset from their actual time values.

#### Improve game-wide cursor visualisation handling [\#1887](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1887) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

The game cursor is now only used when actually targeting the playfield. This means when something like a skip button appears on top of the playfield, the menu cursor becomes visible again. Visually this still needs some tweaks (the playfield cursor trail stops a bit abruptly right now) but it's a step in the right direciton.

#### Basic functionality completed for osu!catch

Basic autoplay (not yet humanlike) and completed gameplay have now been implemented! This marks all four game modes as complete. While there's still much to be done, it's a matter of tweaking from this point forward rather than reimplementing the rulesets themselves.

Sorry for the bad playing :P

#### Add setting to adjust background blur level during gameplay [\#1754](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1754) ([ColdVolcano](https://github.com/ColdVolcano))

Currently using the same taiko-specific sample set as `osu-stable`. On a slightly related note, keep a look out for a brand new sample set for the default skin hitting later this week (osu! mode, not taiko).

## [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) *The new web front-end. [Already live](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) but hasn't yet replaced the old site, pending feature parity.*

Alongside the changes below, a lot of effort has been going into optimising the site experience from a performance perspective, reducing load times and improving search results.

#### Paginate beatmap pack list and use the same sort on all types. [\#2248](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2248) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

A bit of maintenance on the pack listing as the number of available packs continues to increase, including better default sorting, pagination and tidying up old download links to deprecated sites. We'll be using this page more going forward as we do Mapper's Guild releases and other special packs!

#### Add hype and nomination count to beatmapset search results [\#2203](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2203) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

You can now sort pending beatmaps by [nominations and hype counts](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets?sort=nominations_desc&s=4) to get a deeper insight into the status of beatmaps in the modding stage.

![](https://puu.sh/z67Oc/a1e0d4167e.jpg)

#### Better linkify for beatmapset discussions [\#2196](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2196) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

Linking between issues in modding discussions is now supported, and will display in a more compact form.

![](https://puu.sh/z67Xe/62d075982a.png)

#### Make beatmapset discussion permalinks useful [\#2173](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2173) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

You can now click the permalink link to copy to clipboard automatically.

![](https://puu.sh/z6xRM/68c0df8b3c.gif)

#### Increase beatmapset discussion post character limit [\#2192](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2192) ([nanaya](https://github.com/nanaya))

Due to popular demand, we've increased the character limit per discussion post to 750 (previously 500).

#### Reduce menu delay and auto resize menu [\#2122](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2122) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

The global menu should now behave a bit nicer. We know it can still feel a bit hidden and awkward, but are going to be addressing this in a larger design change coming later on. For now it should be a touch more usable.

As the number of localisations contributed continues to expand, the global menu was getting very tall. It now automatically resized based on the current displayed selection.

![](https://puu.sh/z689j/84e6b6fcc9.gif)

#### Add fancier tooltips in beatmap listing [\#2120](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2120) ([LiquidPL](https://github.com/LiquidPL))

Get difficulty star ratings on hover.

![](https://puu.sh/z68ht/1f46232037.gif)

#### Allow beatmap discussions sorting by post or updated time  [\#2113](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2113) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

![](https://puu.sh/z69A5/586f0c495a.gif)

Another requested feature for the modding system.

#### Show correct star difficulty for converted beatmaps [\#2063](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2063) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

Pretty self-explanatory, but star difficulty now shows correctly on the beatmap info pages.

#### Ensure that all suggestions/problems are resolved before allowing nomination [\#2062](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2062) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

Just one extra automation to make life easier for beatmap nominators. Now, all pending issues are required to be resolved before further action can be taken, avoiding the need for manual checks and potential human error.

#### Limit loaded forum posts to 250 [\#2056](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2056) ([nanaya](https://github.com/nanaya))

To avoid huge memory consumption, posts are now unloaded when scrolling continuously in very long forum threads.
