title: dev changelog 20180128
---

Another week of solid progress! Hoped to get this post up on Friday but alas, things got busy. As a side-note the new t-shirt designs will be available on the store today, so look out for those if you are interested!

## [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu) *The osu!lazer project. The future of the osu! client. Download preview releases from [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases) and follow along!*

### Important Changes

#### Implement ruleset-specific config managers and attach them to the global OnScreenDisplay [\#1929](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1929) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

Individual rulesets can now have configuration settings (which are stored permanently to the database). The first use-case for this is osu!mania's scroll speed setting, which is now remembered per key variant!

#### Add new default hitsounds \(thanks to cYsmix\) [\#1975](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1975) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

cYsmix has been hard at work on creating a fresh set of hitsounds to become the lazer defaults. Aiming for a more punchy set which are both nice to the ears but also give instant feedback - something a lot of higher level players require from hitsounds.

Here's two examples, but I highly recommend you go check your favourite hitsounded beatmaps to see how they sound (and provide feedback if possible!):

#### Add more human-like catch autoplay support [\#1952](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1952) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

<div style="width: 100%; height: 0px; position: relative; padding-bottom: 60.497%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/ly1a1/ojyzpk" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;"></iframe></div>

#### Overall difficulty [\#1938](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1938) ([Shawdooow](https://github.com/Shawdooow))

Following variable approach rate, overall difficulty has now been implemented. For the time being, it affects judgement windows.

## [osu-framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework) *The game framework behind osu!lazer. Written from scratch with osu! in mind, but very extensible.*

### Important Changes

#### Improvements to audio subsytem disposal logic [\#1340](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1340) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

Allows for better handling of nested audio components, making stopping osu!direct panel tracks (and muting global sound at the same time) much cleaner than previously possible.

#### Add a way to generate tracked settings from ConfigManager [\#1339](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1339) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

Allows for the osu! game to more easily extract on-screen display parameters from configuration stores directly.

### Other Changes

- Stop ConfigManager from setting a default when calling GetOriginalBindable [\#1352](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1352) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))
- Bindable parsing fixes [\#1351](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1351) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))
- Make ini based config manager its own class [\#1349](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1349) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))
- Stop bindings from interrupting each other when in unique mode [\#1344](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1344) ([ThePyrotechnic](https://github.com/ThePyrotechnic))
- Allow dependency injection caching by specific type [\#1343](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1343) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))
- Make Tooltip a VisibilityContainer instead of OverlayContainer [\#1335](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1335) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))
- Fix DllResourceStore not being able to handle hyphens in file path [\#1327](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1327) ([FreezyLemon](https://github.com/FreezyLemon))
- Allow setting the filtering mode of textures loaded by TextureStore [\#1292](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/pull/1292) ([jorolf](https://github.com/jorolf))

## [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) *The new web front-end. [Already live](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) but hasn't yet replaced the old site, pending feature parity.*

Nothing really important to see here, it'd seem. Just bug fixes and infrastructure changes. Maybe next time!

#### Nomination tweaks [\#2276](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2276) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

Based on bug reports and feedback, we resolved some issues involving the nomination limit. Speaking of which, the daily limit has also been raised from 2 to 10 after it was determined that two is now too low (as "first" nominations are counted where previously only "second" or "qualifying" nominations were counted).
