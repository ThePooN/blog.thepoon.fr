title: dev changelog 20180206
---

Trying to keep these coming once a week is pretty tough, but here we are (only a couple of days late!). Huge appreciation as always to those who contributed this time around.

As a side note: full tablet support is only days away from being deployed live to lazer, so for those of you that have been holding off due to not being able to play with your tablet, make sure to check back soon!

## [osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu) *The osu!lazer project. The future of the osu! client. Download preview releases from [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/releases) and follow along!*

#### Implement Catmull-Rom curve approximator [\#2003](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2003) ([smoogipoo](https://github.com/smoogipoo))

Everyone's (least) favourite slider curve type is now supported by lazer. Play through more of the old classic beatmaps that you love so much, without the sliders taking on smooth curved shapes.

#### Update design of "revert to default" button [\#2011](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2011) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

#### Store and show SSPlus and SPlus statistics on user page [\#2004](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/2004) ([tgi74](https://github.com/tgi74))

Just like the new site, you can now see hidden/flashlight SS/S counts separate from normal ones

#### Fix osu!catch never reaching the result screen [\#1999](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1999) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

You can now complete catch beatmaps. Oops.

#### Add the ability to duck volume when the game is inactive [\#1997](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1997) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

While the transitions are not yet as smooth as you'd expect, you now have complete control over how much sound osu! is going to generate when it's not the active window.

#### Update taiko hitsounds \(courtesey of cYsmix\) [\#1994](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1994) ([peppy](https://github.com/peppy))

cYsmix has done it again, providing a new default sound set that does wonders to give osu!taiko a fresh feel.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:60.521%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/g6htr/ofhs" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

#### Ability to mute the game using F4 \(or button on volume control\) [\#1921](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1921) ([aQaTL](https://github.com/aQaTL))

Simple yet effective. Design is obviously not final (get a preview of that [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu/issues/1982)).

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:66.667%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/ms5hm/tdlhbh" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

#### Add URL handling to chat [\#1667](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1667) ([FreezyLemon](https://github.com/FreezyLemon))

This has been in and out of the release builds as I had it manually cherry-picked for releases (felt it was pretty important), but is now here to stay! You can now freely open up web links in chat. In the cases there's an in-game view for what you are looking at, it'll prefer that over opening the site. The number of in-game overlays will expand as time goes by.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:60.521%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/wo1lf/oubghk" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

#### Implement a gameplay visual settings overlay [\#1879](https://github.com/ppy/osu/pull/1879) ([UselessToucan](https://github.com/UselessToucan))

You can now adjust settings before entering gameplay (at the "loading" screen). For now a preview is not available, but this will be added in the future.

<div style="width:100%;height:0px;position:relative;padding-bottom:66.093%;"><iframe src="https://streamable.com/s/r2j9i/snndfm" frameborder="0" width="100%" height="100%" allowfullscreen style="width:100%;height:100%;position:absolute;left:0px;top:0px;overflow:hidden;"></iframe></div>

Code quality, performance and bug fixes. Nothing exceptional to see here!

## [osu-web](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web) *The new web front-end. [Already live](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) but hasn't yet replaced the old site, pending feature parity.*

#### Elasticsearch 6 support [\#2262](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2262) ([notbakaneko](https://github.com/notbakaneko))

With some backend redesign, we were finally able to migrate off an ancient Elasticsearch 1.x instance to the latest version. We still have some improvements to make to the way we are interacting with elasticsearch, but the old site needs to die before this can happen. Needless to say, this is a step in the right direction for improving search quality game-wide.

#### Add playtime to user profiles [\#2290](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2290) ([LiquidPL](https://github.com/LiquidPL))

Due to popular request, play time is back on profiles. This time precise to the second!

#### Beatmap scoreboard revamp [\#2292](https://github.com/ppy/osu-web/pull/2292) ([nekodex](https://github.com/nekodex))

After reading through all the feedback you guys threw at us regarding leaderboard design, flyte got to work trying to make sure he could please everyone. The design is now implemented and live at the new site and has so far received some very positive feedback. Glad you guys like it!
